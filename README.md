## My process
 - I used grids to layout this page 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind css
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

During the process of making this page I learned a lot about css grid. Use of flexible with vs fixed width changes whole layout, So have to be more carefull while choosing the width type. 

Fixing the width of the image was also a challenging part.

Learned a new css property of overlay of background color. 


### Continued development

I have to focus more on overlay property along with width and height of the box with respect to its container.
